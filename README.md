Text Analyzer is a Python-based application designed to analyze textual data from multiple files efficiently. 
The tool reads text files, cleans them by removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters, and then generates detailed statistical insights. 
It identifies the most common words, calculates word and character counts, computes the average word length, and exports results to JSON and CSV formats for further use. 
This project is ideal for students, researchers, or professionals who need to extract meaningful patterns from text data.
